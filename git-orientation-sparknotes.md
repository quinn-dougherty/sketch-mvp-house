1. use project github org
- - repositories within org will be created by PM
- - name your branch `firstname-lastname` on each repository
- - let PM handle pulls to `master` branch 

2. when encounter merge conflict: 
- - checkout master
- - DO NOT CHECKOUT MASTER WITHOUT COMMITTING YOUR BRANCH. or use `git stash`. 


3. DO NOT USE `git commit -am `. it creates a ton of unnecessary merge conflicts
